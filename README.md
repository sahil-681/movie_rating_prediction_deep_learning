# movie_rating_prediction_deep_learning
Deep Learning Final Project:
This project aimed to predict movie ratings based on movie reviews using a deep learning approach. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
neural network was trained on a dataset of movie reviews and corresponding ratings, and its perfor- mance was evaluated on both 
validation and test sets. The results showed that while the model was able to achieve moderate accuracy on the validation set, its 
performance on the test set was lower, suggesting that the model may not be generalizing well to new data. Possible reasons for this 
were explored, including overfitting and model architecture, and avenues for future work were identified. Overall, this project 
provides a starting point for the development of a more accurate and robust movie rating prediction model, which could have practical 
applications in the film industry and beyond.
